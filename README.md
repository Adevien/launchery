A lightweight, **(and hopefully fast)** GTK4 application launcher for Wayland.  
Built with [`gtk4`](https://gtk-rs.org/), [`libadwaita`](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/), and [`gtk4-layer-shell`](https://github.com/wmww/gtk4-layer-shell-rs),  
it brings a modern app launcher experience that integrates seamlessly into your desktop.
